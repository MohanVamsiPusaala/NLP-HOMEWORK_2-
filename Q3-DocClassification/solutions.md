# Q3 – Worked Example Document Classification

Test document: **predictable no fun**

---

## Given (from Q2)
- Priors: P(−) = 3/5 = 0.6 ; P(+) = 2/5 = 0.4  
- Vocabulary size V = 20  
- Negative class total tokens = 14 → denominator = 14 + 20 = 34  
- From Q2:
  - count(predictable | −) = 2 → P(predictable | −) = (2+1)/34 = 3/34 ≈ 0.0882353  
  - count(fun | −) = 0 → P(fun | −) = (0+1)/34 = 1/34 ≈ 0.0294118

> Note: The count for "no" in the negative class is not given in the assignment. A numeric score for the negative class requires count(no | −). The calculation below shows the result assuming count(no | −) = 1 only to demonstrate steps; if you have the true count replace it in the same formula.

## Negative class score (showing multiplication steps)

Assume count(no | −) = 1 → P(no | −) = (1+1)/34 = 2/34 ≈ 0.0588235

Likelihood:
- P(d | −) = P(predictable | −) × P(no | −) × P(fun | −)
- = (3/34) × (2/34) × (1/34)

Step-by-step:
1. 3/34 × 2/34 = 6 / 1156 ≈ 0.0051860  
2. 0.0051860 × 1/34 = 6 / 39224 ≈ 0.000152985

Multiply by prior:
- Score(−) = P(−) × P(d | −) = 0.6 × (6 / 39224) = 3.6 / 39224 ≈ **0.000091791**

(If count(no | −) is different, replace 2 in the numerator above with (count(no|−)+1) and recompute.)

## Positive class score

Using add-1 smoothing, the positive-class score is:

- Denominator for positive class = (total_positive_tokens + V) — not given.
- For each word w in the document: P(w | +) = (count(w | +) + 1) / (total_positive_tokens + V)

Thus:
- P(d | +) = Π_{w ∈ {predictable, no, fun}} (count(w | +) + 1) / (total_positive_tokens + V)
- Score(+) = P(+) × P(d | +)

**Numeric value for Score(+) cannot be computed here because `count(predictable|+)`, `count(no|+)`, `count(fun|+)`, and `total_positive_tokens` are not provided.**

## Decision

- Numeric Score(−) is computed above (using count(no|−)=1 as an example): **~0.00009179**.  
- Numeric Score(+) cannot be computed from the information given.  

**Conclusion:** A final class assignment **cannot be determined** without the positive-class token counts (and total positive tokens). To decide, compute Score(+) using the positive counts and compare Score(−) vs Score(+).
