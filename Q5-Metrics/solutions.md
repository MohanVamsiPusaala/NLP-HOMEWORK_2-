# Q5 – Evaluation Metrics from a Multi-Class Confusion Matrix

## Confusion Matrix (System \ Gold)

|            | Cat | Dog | Rabbit |
|------------|-----|-----|--------|
| **Cat**    |  5  | 10  |   5    |
| **Dog**    | 15  | 20  |  10    |
| **Rabbit** |  0  | 15  |  10    |

Total animals = 90

## 1. Per-Class Precision and Recall

**Cat**  
- TP = 5  
- FP = 15 (from Dog) + 0 (from Rabbit) = 15  
- FN = 10 (from Dog) + 5 (from Rabbit) = 15  
- Precision = 5 / (5 + 15) = 5 / 20 = **0.25**  
- Recall = 5 / (5 + 15) = 5 / 20 = **0.25**

**Dog**  
- TP = 20  
- FP = 10 (from Cat) + 15 (from Rabbit) = 25  
- FN = 15 (from Cat) + 10 (from Rabbit) = 25  
- Precision = 20 / (20 + 25) = 20 / 45 ≈ **0.444**  
- Recall = 20 / (20 + 25) = 20 / 45 ≈ **0.444**

**Rabbit**  
- TP = 10  
- FP = 5 (from Cat) + 10 (from Dog) = 15  
- FN = 5 (from Cat) + 10 (from Dog) = 15  
- Precision = 10 / (10 + 15) = 10 / 25 = **0.40**  
- Recall = 10 / (10 + 15) = 10 / 25 = **0.40**

## 2. Macro vs Micro Averaging

**Macro-averaged Precision** = (0.25 + 0.444 + 0.40) / 3 ≈ **0.365**  
**Macro-averaged Recall** = (0.25 + 0.444 + 0.40) / 3 ≈ **0.365**

**Micro-averaged Precision** = total TP / (total TP + total FP)  
- Total TP = 5 + 20 + 10 = 35  
- Total FP = 15 + 25 + 15 = 55  
- Micro Precision = 35 / (35 + 55) = 35 / 90 ≈ **0.389**

**Micro-averaged Recall** = total TP / (total TP + total FN)  
- Total FN = 15 + 25 + 15 = 55  
- Micro Recall = 35 / (35 + 55) = 35 / 90 ≈ **0.389**

## 3. Difference between Macro and Micro

- **Macro averaging**: treats all classes equally. Each class gets the same weight, no matter how many samples it has.  
- **Micro averaging**: counts all decisions together. Bigger classes influence the score more.  

So macro is fairer across classes, while micro reflects overall accuracy across all data.
